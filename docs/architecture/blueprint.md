# MobileVC Architecture Blueprint

Last updated: 2026-04-28

This blueprint documents the current code path. It is descriptive, not a product roadmap.

## 1. High-Level Shape

MobileVC connects a Flutter client to a Go backend over WebSocket. The backend owns runner lifecycle, session persistence, native Claude/Codex history mirroring, permissions, review state, and embedded Flutter Web hosting.

Main files:

- Flutter state hub: `mobile_vc/lib/features/session/session_controller.dart`
- Flutter WebSocket service: `mobile_vc/lib/data/services/mobilevc_ws_service.dart`
- Flutter config/QR parsing: `mobile_vc/lib/core/config/app_config.dart`
- Go WebSocket handler: `internal/ws/handler.go`
- Runtime manager: `internal/runtime/manager.go`
- Protocol structs: `internal/protocol/event.go`
- npm launcher: `bin/mobilevc.js`

## 2. Launcher and Connection Bootstrap

1. User runs `mobilevc` or `mobilevc start` from a project directory.
2. `bin/mobilevc.js` loads launcher config from `~/.mobilevc/launcher/config.json`.
3. It starts the platform backend binary with:
   - `PORT`
   - `AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `RUNTIME_WORKSPACE_ROOT=process.cwd()`
4. It prints local/LAN URLs and a terminal QR code.
5. The URL includes `token` and `cwd`; scanning it in Flutter fills host, port, token, and CWD.
6. Flutter persists the resulting `AppConfig` and derives the backend URLs from the runtime page scheme: HTTP/native uses `ws://host:port/ws?token=...`; HTTPS Flutter Web uses `wss://host:port/ws?token=...` and `https://.../download`.

Important current behavior: if a backend is already running, QR generation still uses the current `mobilevc` invocation directory for `cwd`, so users can re-scan from the intended project directory.

## 3. Flutter Connection State Machine

`SessionController.connect()`:

1. Opens WebSocket via `MobileVcWsService.connect(...)`.
2. Marks connected state and bootstraps runtime/session data.
3. Switches to configured CWD and requests runtime info, skill catalog, memory list, session list, ADB status, session context, permission rules, and review state.
4. Requests `task_snapshot_get` to immediately calibrate whether the desktop task is still running.
5. If a session is already selected, sends `session_delta_get` with:
   - `sessionId`
   - `cwd`
   - `reason`
   - known event/history/diff/terminal cursors

`resumeConnectionIfNeeded()`:

- If the socket is still considered connected, it sends `session_delta_get` directly.
- Otherwise it schedules foreground reconnect.

Health monitor:

- Periodically sends `action=ping`; the server replies with `pong` and a `task_snapshot` when a session is selected.
- Any incoming event refreshes the last-seen timestamp.
- If no event arrives within the silence timeout, Flutter closes the stale channel and enters reconnect.

## 4. Go WebSocket Handler

`internal/ws/handler.go` handles these relevant actions:

- `ping`: replies with a lightweight `pong` event and emits `task_snapshot` for the current session.
- `session_list`: returns MobileVC sessions merged with native Claude/Codex mirrors.
- `session_load`: loads persisted projection/history and attaches the runtime session.
- `task_snapshot_get`: emits a service-authoritative task snapshot for UI continuity.
- `session_delta_get`: rebuilds projection/history from backend state and returns only new history entries, updated diffs, terminal output suffixes, review/context metadata, and task snapshot state.
- `session_resume`: full-sync fallback that rebuilds projection/history, emits review state and task snapshot, optionally replays only blocking prompt/interaction events, and returns `session_resume_result`.
- `exec`: starts a command/AI runner.
- `input`: sends input to active PTY or resumes a managed Claude session.
- `permission_decision` / `review_decision`: continue permission/review flows.

Server writer behavior:

- All outbound WS events go through a write channel.
- Writes now set a deadline, so broken mobile/network connections fail instead of blocking indefinitely.

## 5. Runtime Sessions and Replay

`internal/ws/runtime_sessions.go` provides per-session runtime ownership:

- Active listeners receive live events.
- Prompt/interaction events get an event cursor and are buffered.
- Detached sessions can accumulate resume notices.
- `pendingSince(cursor)` is intentionally limited to blocking prompt/interaction events. General progress continuity comes from `session_delta_get` plus `task_snapshot`, not cached log replay.
- `HasActiveConnection(sessionID)` checks listener count to determine if Flutter is online, used by push module.
- `onCleanup` callback fires on runtime session release (immediate, 15-min timeout, or global cleanup) to unlock `ExecutionActive`.

Design choice: the pending buffer is not used as a general log cache. Flutter recovery should directly sync backend projection/history increments and task snapshot.

## 6. AI Command Defaults

Flutter builds preferred AI commands in `_preferredAiCommandForEngine(...)`:

- Claude default: `claude` (`default` model means no `--model` flag).
- Claude explicit model: `claude --model <model>`.
- Codex default: `codex -m gpt-5-codex --config model_reasoning_effort=medium`.
- Gemini: `gemini`.

The UI display model for empty Claude config is `Default`.

## 7. Session and History Model

- MobileVC-owned sessions persist projections in the file store.
- Native Claude sessions are mirrored from `~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/*.jsonl`.
- Native Codex sessions are mirrored from `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite` and `~/.codex/history.jsonl`.
- Session list filtering uses the current CWD and normalizes path variants to reduce Windows/symlink mismatches.
- **Ownership**: `SessionSummary.Ownership` set at creation (`"mobilevc"`), upgraded by `mergeClaudeJSONLToRecord` when desktop Claude CLI writes to JSONL (`"claude-native"`). Flutter uses this as the authoritative external-session signal.
- **ExecutionActive**: Controller state latch — `true` for any non-IDLE state, `false` only on IDLE or runtime session cleanup timeout.

## 8. Flutter Event Handling

`MobileVcMapper` maps backend JSON `type` values into Dart `AppEvent` subclasses.

`SessionController._handleEvent(...)`:

- Tracks event cursors.
- Updates agent/session/runtime state.
- Restores history/projections.
- Maintains timelines, diffs, terminal logs, review state, pending prompts, notifications, and derived activity banners.
- Handles `task_snapshot` as the service-authoritative running/waiting/idle signal for the selected session.
- Treats `ws_closed`, `ws_stream_error`, and `ws_send_error` as unexpected socket disconnects when auto reconnect is enabled.

## 9. Push Notifications

`internal/ws/push_helper.go` and `internal/push/service.go`:

- `prompt_request` / `interaction_request` events always trigger APNs push (user action needed).
- `AgentStateEvent` (THINKING/RUNNING_TOOL), `StepUpdateEvent`, `LogEvent` (assistant_reply), `ErrorEvent` also trigger push when no active WebSocket connection exists.
- Progress events debounced at 30s per session via `Handler.lastProgressPush` map.
- `HasActiveConnection` gates progress pushes: online → skip (WebSocket delivers), offline → send APNs.
- APNs payload includes `Alert` + `AlertBody` so iOS shows banner even when app is suspended.

## 10. Files Worth Updating Together
